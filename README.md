# octopart_scraper


This scraper takes a .rtf file with a list of Digikey or Mouser barcodes and outputs a nice tidy .csv file with the column headings 

Reference: Box #, Part Type, Vendor Part #, Manufacturer Part #, value, v_rating, c_rating, power rating, footprint, pitch, tmp_part, quantity, # of pins

Box number is based on a personal organization system and can be skipped no problem, as it TMP_Part      
Maker sure this is all kept in a folder called BarcodeScanning. 
You must install chromedriver in the same folder, download link is here: http://chromedriver.chromium.org/downloads
